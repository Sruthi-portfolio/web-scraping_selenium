(NCGTC) will cover 75% of the defaulted amount if a borrower defaults on their loan. This provides a safety net against default.
Additionally, interest rates on these loans are set at 2% above the base rate*, further reducing the financial burden on students. Moreover, loans up to ₹4,00,000 require no margin**.
However, for loan amounts exceeding ₹4,00,000, a 5% margin is required for studies within India and a 15% margin for studies abroad. In simpler terms, borrowers must contribute 5% or 15% of the loan amount for domestic or international studies, respectively, for loans above ₹4,00,000. The scheme applies to loans obtained under the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) Model Education Loan Scheme.
Base Rate: A benchmark used to calculate interest rates on loans. Lending institutions add a margin to the base rate to determine the final interest rate for a loan.
In simple terms, the base rate is the minimum interest rate a bank can charge on loans. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sets this rate. When an individual applies for a loan, the bank adds a margin to the base rate to determine the final interest rate payable. This margin represents the bank's profit. For example, if the base rate is 5% and the bank's margin is 2%, the borrower will pay a final interest rate of 7%.
**Margin refers to the portion of the loan amount that the borrower must finance independently. When taking out an education loan, the bank does not provide the full amount. Instead, the borrower must contribute a specified percentage of the loan amount. This is the margin. For instance, if an education loan of ₹10,00,000 is needed, the bank might require a 10% margin. This means the borrower must contribute ₹1,00,000, while the bank lends the remaining  ₹9,00,000.
The following expenses will be covered under this scheme:-
Education loans typically cover tuition, hostel, examination, library, and laboratory fees
For students studying abroad, travel expenses and passage fares may be included
Insurance premiums for the student borrower can be covered (if applicable)
Caution deposits, building funds, or refundable deposits supported by institutional bills or receipts may be considered.
Purchasing books, equipment, instruments, and uniforms can be included in the loan amount.
If a computer is essential for the course, its reasonable cost can be incorporated into the loan.
Other expenses necessary for course completion, such as study tours, project work, and thesis, may also be covered.
Scholarships or fee waivers received by the student borrower can reduce the loan amount.
Fees for management quota seats will be considered if approved by the State Government or a government-approved regulatory body, subject to repayment feasibility.
Reasonable lodging and boarding charges may be considered for students living off-campus.
